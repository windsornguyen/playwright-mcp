# 1. Introduction and Overview

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Why MCP?

MCP helps you build agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs. LLMs frequently need to integrate with data and tools, and MCP provides:
- A growing list of pre-built integrations that your LLM can directly plug into
- The flexibility to switch between LLM providers and vendors
- Best practices for securing your data within your infrastructure

## General Architecture

At its core, MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:
- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP
- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol
- **Local Data Sources**: Your computer's files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access
- **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to

---

# 2. Core Architecture and Concepts

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is built on a flexible, extensible architecture that enables seamless communication between LLM applications and integrations.

MCP follows a client-server architecture where:
- Hosts are LLM applications (like Claude Desktop or IDEs) that initiate connections
- Clients maintain 1:1 connections with servers, inside the host application
- Servers provide context, tools, and prompts to clients

## Core Components

### Protocol Layer
The protocol layer handles message framing, request/response linking, and high-level communication patterns.

Key classes include:
- Protocol
- Client
- Server

### Transport Layer
The transport layer handles the actual communication between clients and servers. MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms:

- **Stdio transport**: Uses standard input/output for communication, ideal for local processes
- **HTTP with SSE transport**: Uses Server-Sent Events for server-to-client messages, HTTP POST for client-to-server messages

All transports use JSON-RPC 2.0 to exchange messages.

## Message Types

MCP has these main types of messages:
- **Requests**: Expect a response from the other side
- **Results**: Successful responses to requests
- **Errors**: Indicate that a request failed
- **Notifications**: One-way messages that don't expect a response

## Connection Lifecycle

### 1. Initialization
- Client sends `initialize` request with protocol version and capabilities
- Server responds with its protocol version and capabilities
- Client sends `initialized` notification as acknowledgment
- Normal message exchange begins

### 2. Message Exchange
After initialization, the following patterns are supported:
- Request-Response: Client or server sends requests, the other responds
- Notifications: Either party sends one-way messages

### 3. Termination
Either party can terminate the connection:
- Clean shutdown via `close()`
- Transport disconnection
- Error conditions

## Error Handling

MCP defines these standard error codes:
```typescript
enum ErrorCode {
  // Standard JSON-RPC error codes
  ParseError = -32700,
  InvalidRequest = -32600,
  MethodNotFound = -32601,
  InvalidParams = -32602,
  InternalError = -32603,
}
```

SDKs and applications can define their own error codes above -32000.

## Implementation Example

Here's a basic example of implementing an MCP server:

```typescript
import { Server } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";

const server = new Server({
  name: "example-server",
  version: "1.0.0"
}, {
  capabilities: {
    resources: {}
  }
});

// Handle requests
server.setRequestHandler(ListResourcesRequestSchema, async () => {
  return {
    resources: [
      {
        uri: "example://resource",
        name: "Example Resource"
      }
    ]
  };
});

// Connect transport
const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
await server.connect(transport);
```

# 3. Protocol Specification (Version 2025-06-18)

## Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. This specification defines the authoritative protocol requirements, based on the TypeScript schema in schema.ts.

## Key Principles
- **Servers should be extremely easy to build**
- **Servers should be highly composable**
- **Servers should not be able to read the whole conversation**
- **Features can be added progressively**

## Base Protocol

### Message Types

#### Requests
```typescript
interface JSONRPCRequest {
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  id: string | number;  // MUST NOT be null
  method: string;
  params?: { [key: string]: unknown };
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Requests MUST include a string or integer ID
- Unlike base JSON-RPC, the ID MUST NOT be null
- The request ID MUST NOT have been previously used by the requestor within the same session

#### Responses
```typescript
interface JSONRPCResponse {
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  id: string | number;
  result?: { [key: string]: unknown };
  error?: {
    code: number;
    message: string;
    data?: unknown;
  };
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Responses MUST include the same ID as the request
- Either `result` or `error` MUST be set, but not both
- Error codes MUST be integers

#### Notifications
```typescript
interface JSONRPCNotification {
  jsonrpc: "2.0";
  method: string;
  params?: { [key: string]: unknown };
  // No id field
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Notifications MUST NOT include an ID
- The receiver MUST NOT send a response

## Lifecycle Management

### Initialization

**Initialize Request:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
    "capabilities": {
      "roots": { "listChanged": true },
      "sampling": {},
      "elicitation": {}
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleClient",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

**Initialize Response:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
    "capabilities": {
      "logging": {},
      "prompts": { "listChanged": true },
      "resources": { "subscribe": true, "listChanged": true },
      "tools": { "listChanged": true }
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "ExampleServer",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

## Security Requirements

### Authorization
- HTTP-based transports SHOULD conform to OAuth 2.1 specification
- STDIO transports SHOULD retrieve credentials from environment
- Based on OAuth 2.1 with RFC extensions

### Token Validation
- Servers MUST validate token audience
- Servers MUST reject tokens not issued for them
- Servers MUST follow OAuth 2.1 validation requirements

### Communication Security
- All authorization endpoints MUST use HTTPS
- Redirect URIs MUST be localhost or HTTPS
- Implement PKCE for authorization code protection

---

# 4. Resources

Resources are a core primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allow servers to expose data and content that can be read by clients and used as context for LLM interactions.

Resources are designed to be application-controlled, meaning that the client application can decide how and when they should be used. Different MCP clients may handle resources differently:
- Claude Desktop currently requires users to explicitly select resources before they can be used
- Other clients might automatically select resources based on heuristics
- Some implementations may even allow the AI model itself to determine which resources to use

## Overview

Resources represent any kind of data that an MCP server wants to make available to clients. This can include:
- File contents
- Database records
- API responses
- Live system data
- Screenshots and images
- Log files
- And more

Each resource is identified by a unique URI and can contain either text or binary data.

## Resource URIs

Resources are identified using URIs that follow this format:
```
<protocol>://<path>
```

For example:
- `file:///home/user/documents/report.pdf`
- `postgres://database/customers/schema`
- `screen://localhost/display1`

The protocol and path structure is defined by the MCP server implementation. Servers can define their own custom URI schemes.

## Resource Types

### Text Resources
Text resources contain UTF-8 encoded text data. These are suitable for:
- Source code
- Configuration files
- Log files
- JSON/XML data
- Plain text

### Binary Resources
Binary resources contain raw binary data encoded in base64. These are suitable for:
- Images
- PDFs
- Audio files
- Video files
- Other non-text formats

## Resource Discovery

### Direct Resources
Servers expose a list of concrete resources via the `resources/list` endpoint. Each resource includes:
```typescript
{
  uri: string;         // Unique identifier for the resource
  name: string;        // Human-readable name
  description?: string; // Optional description
  mimeType?: string;   // Optional MIME type
  size?: number;       // Optional size in bytes
}
```

### Resource Templates
For dynamic resources, servers can expose URI templates that clients can use to construct valid resource URIs:
```typescript
{
  uriTemplate: string;  // URI template following RFC 6570
  name: string;         // Human-readable name for this type
  description?: string; // Optional description
  mimeType?: string;    // Optional MIME type for all matching resources
}
```

## Reading Resources

To read a resource, clients make a `resources/read` request with the resource URI.

The server responds with a list of resource contents:
```typescript
{
  contents: [
    {
      uri: string;        // The URI of the resource
      mimeType?: string;  // Optional MIME type
      // One of:
      text?: string;      // For text resources
      blob?: string;      // For binary resources (base64 encoded)
    }
  ]
}
```

Servers may return multiple resources in response to one `resources/read` request. This could be used, for example, to return a list of files inside a directory when the directory is read.

## Resource Updates

MCP supports real-time updates for resources through two mechanisms:

### List Changes
Servers can notify clients when their list of available resources changes via the `notifications/resources/list_changed` notification.

### Content Changes
Clients can subscribe to updates for specific resources:
- Client sends `resources/subscribe` with resource URI
- Server sends `notifications/resources/updated` when the resource changes
- Client can fetch latest content with `resources/read`
- Client can unsubscribe with `resources/unsubscribe`

---

# 5. Tools

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows servers to expose tools that can be invoked by language models. Tools enable models to interact with external systems, such as querying databases, calling APIs, or performing computations.

## User Interaction Model

Tools in MCP are designed to be model-controlled, meaning that the language model can discover and invoke tools automatically based on its contextual understanding and the user's prompts.

However, implementations are free to expose tools through any interface pattern that suits their needs—the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

For trust & safety and security, there SHOULD always be a human in the loop with the ability to deny tool invocations.

Applications SHOULD:
- Provide UI that makes clear which tools are being exposed to the AI model
- Insert clear visual indicators when tools are invoked
- Present confirmation prompts to the user for operations, to ensure a human is in the loop

## Capabilities

Servers that support tools MUST declare the `tools` capability:
```typescript
{
  capabilities: {
    tools: {
      listChanged?: boolean
    }
  }
}
```

`listChanged` indicates whether the server will emit notifications when the list of available tools changes.

## Protocol Messages

### Listing Tools
To discover available tools, clients send a `tools/list` request:

Request:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/list"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "tools": [
      {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather for a location",
        "inputSchema": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "location": {
              "type": "string",
              "description": "City name"
            }
          },
          "required": ["location"]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Calling Tools
To invoke a tool, clients send a `tools/call` request:

Request:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "arguments": {
      "location": "San Francisco"
    }
  }
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "The current weather in San Francisco is 72°F and sunny."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Data Types

### Tool Definition
A tool definition includes:
- `name`: Unique identifier for the tool
- `title`: Optional human-readable name of the tool for display purposes
- `description`: Human-readable description of functionality
- `inputSchema`: JSON Schema defining expected parameters
- `outputSchema`: Optional JSON Schema defining expected output structure
- `annotations`: Optional properties describing tool behavior

### Tool Result
Tool results may contain structured or unstructured content:

- **Text Content**: Plain text responses
- **Image Content**: Base64-encoded images
- **Audio Content**: Base64-encoded audio
- **Resource Links**: References to MCP resources
- **Embedded Resources**: Full resource content
- **Structured Content**: JSON objects with defined schemas

## Error Handling

Tools use two error reporting mechanisms:

1. **Protocol Errors**: Standard JSON-RPC errors for issues like:
   - Unknown tools
   - Invalid arguments
   - Server errors

2. **Tool Execution Errors**: Reported in tool results with `isError: true`:
   - API failures
   - Invalid input data
   - Business logic errors

Tool errors should be reported within the result object, not as MCP protocol-level errors. This allows the LLM to see and potentially handle the error.

# 6. Prompts

Prompts enable servers to define reusable prompt templates and workflows that clients can easily surface to users and LLMs. They provide a powerful way to standardize and share common LLM interactions.

Prompts are designed to be user-controlled, meaning they are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the user being able to explicitly select them for use.

## Overview

Prompts in MCP are predefined templates that can:
- Accept dynamic arguments
- Include context from resources
- Chain multiple interactions
- Guide specific workflows
- Surface as UI elements (like slash commands)

## Prompt Structure

Each prompt is defined with:
```typescript
{
  name: string;        // Unique identifier for the prompt
  description?: string; // Human-readable description
  arguments?: [        // Optional list of arguments
    {
      name: string;        // Argument identifier
      description?: string; // Argument description
      required?: boolean;   // Whether argument is required
    }
  ]
}
```

## Discovering Prompts

Clients can discover available prompts through the `prompts/list` endpoint:
```json
{
  "method": "prompts/list"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "name": "analyze-code",
      "description": "Analyze code for potential improvements",
      "arguments": [
        {
          "name": "language",
          "description": "Programming language",
          "required": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Using Prompts

To use a prompt, clients make a `prompts/get` request:
```json
{
  "method": "prompts/get",
  "params": {
    "name": "analyze-code",
    "arguments": {
      "language": "python"
    }
  }
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "description": "Analyze Python code for potential improvements",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Please analyze the following Python code for potential improvements..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Dynamic Prompts

Prompts can be dynamic and include:
- **Argument substitution**: Replace placeholders with provided arguments
- **Resource embedding**: Include content from MCP resources
- **Conditional logic**: Different prompts based on arguments
- **Multi-step workflows**: Chain multiple prompts together

---

# 7. Sampling

Sampling is a powerful MCP feature that allows servers to request LLM completions through the client, enabling sophisticated agentic behaviors while maintaining security and privacy.

*Note: This feature of MCP is not yet supported in the Claude Desktop client.*

## How Sampling Works

The sampling flow follows these steps:
1. Server sends a `sampling/createMessage` request to the client
2. Client reviews the request and can modify it
3. Client samples from an LLM
4. Client reviews the completion
5. Client returns the result to the server

This human-in-the-loop design ensures users maintain control over what the LLM sees and generates.

## Message Format

Sampling requests use a standardized message format:
```typescript
{
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user" | "assistant",
      content: {
        type: "text" | "image",
        // For text:
        text?: string,
        // For images:
        data?: string,    // base64 encoded
        mimeType?: string
      }
    }
  ],
  modelPreferences?: {
    hints?: [{
      name?: string     // Suggested model name/family
    }],
    costPriority?: number,        // 0-1, importance of minimizing cost
    speedPriority?: number,       // 0-1, importance of low latency
    intelligencePriority?: number // 0-1, importance of capabilities
  },
  systemPrompt?: string,
  includeContext?: "none" | "thisServer" | "allServers",
  temperature?: number,
  maxTokens: number,
  stopSequences?: string[],
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
}
```

## Request Parameters

### Messages
The `messages` array contains the conversation history to send to the LLM. Each message has:
- `role`: Either "user" or "assistant"
- `content`: The message content, which can be:
  - Text content with a `text` field
  - Image content with `data` (base64) and `mimeType` fields

### Model Preferences
The `modelPreferences` object allows servers to specify their model selection preferences:
- `hints`: Array of model name suggestions that clients can use to select an appropriate model
- Priority values (0-1 normalized):
  - `costPriority`: Importance of minimizing costs
  - `speedPriority`: Importance of low latency response
  - `intelligencePriority`: Importance of advanced model capabilities

### Context Inclusion
The `includeContext` parameter specifies what MCP context to include:
- `"none"`: No additional context
- `"thisServer"`: Include context from the requesting server
- `"allServers"`: Include context from all connected MCP servers

The client controls what context is actually included.

---

# 8. Roots

Roots are a concept in MCP that define the boundaries where servers can operate. They provide a way for clients to inform servers about relevant resources and their locations.

## What are Roots?

A root is a URI that a client suggests a server should focus on. When a client connects to a server, it declares which roots the server should work with. While primarily used for filesystem paths, roots can be any valid URI including HTTP URLs.

For example, roots could be:
- `file:///home/user/projects/myapp` (local directory)
- `https://api.example.com/v1` (API endpoint)
- `git://github.com/user/repo` (Git repository)

## Why Use Roots?

Roots serve several important purposes:
- **Guidance**: They inform servers about relevant resources and locations
- **Clarity**: Roots make it clear which resources are part of your workspace
- **Organization**: Multiple roots let you work with different resources simultaneously

## How Roots Work

When a client supports roots, it:
- Declares the `roots` capability during connection
- Provides a list of suggested roots to the server
- Notifies the server when roots change (if supported)

While roots are informational and not strictly enforcing, servers should:
- Respect the provided roots
- Use root URIs to locate and access resources
- Prioritize operations within root boundaries

## Common Use Cases

Roots are commonly used to define:
- Project directories
- Repository locations
- API endpoints
- Configuration locations
- Resource boundaries

## Example

Here's how a typical MCP client might expose roots:
```json
{
  "roots": [
    {
      "uri": "file:///home/user/projects/frontend",
      "name": "Frontend Repository"
    },
    {
      "uri": "https://api.example.com/v1",
      "name": "API Endpoint"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration suggests the server focus on both a local repository and an API endpoint while keeping them logically separated.

# 9. Transports

MCP uses JSON-RPC to encode messages. JSON-RPC messages MUST be UTF-8 encoded.

The protocol currently defines two standard transport mechanisms for client-server communication:
1. **stdio**: Communication over standard input and standard output
2. **Streamable HTTP**: HTTP-based communication with optional Server-Sent Events

Clients SHOULD support stdio whenever possible. It is also possible for clients and servers to implement custom transports in a pluggable fashion.

## stdio Transport

In the stdio transport:
- The client launches the MCP server as a subprocess
- The server reads JSON-RPC messages from its standard input (`stdin`) and sends messages to its standard output (`stdout`)
- Messages may be JSON-RPC requests, notifications, responses—or a JSON-RPC batch containing one or more requests and/or notifications
- Messages are delimited by newlines, and MUST NOT contain embedded newlines
- The server MAY write UTF-8 strings to its standard error (`stderr`) for logging purposes. Clients MAY capture, forward, or ignore this logging
- The server MUST NOT write anything to its `stdout` that is not a valid MCP message
- The client MUST NOT write anything to the server's `stdin` that is not a valid MCP message

## Streamable HTTP Transport

*This replaces the HTTP+SSE transport from protocol version 2024-11-05.*

In the Streamable HTTP transport, the server operates as an independent process that can handle multiple client connections. This transport uses HTTP POST and GET requests. Server can optionally make use of Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream multiple server messages.

The server MUST provide a single HTTP endpoint path (the MCP endpoint) that supports both POST and GET methods. For example: `https://example.com/mcp`

### Security Warning
When implementing Streamable HTTP transport:
- Servers MUST validate the `Origin` header on all incoming connections to prevent DNS rebinding attacks
- When running locally, servers SHOULD bind only to localhost (127.0.0.1) rather than all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- Servers SHOULD implement proper authentication for all connections

### Sending Messages to the Server
Every JSON-RPC message sent from the client MUST be a new HTTP POST request to the MCP endpoint.

- The client MUST use HTTP POST to send JSON-RPC messages to the MCP endpoint
- The client MUST include an `Accept` header, listing both `application/json` and `text/event-stream` as supported content types
- The body of the POST request MUST be one of the following:
  - A single JSON-RPC message
  - A JSON-RPC batch (array of messages)

### Response Handling
- If the input consists solely of JSON-RPC responses or notifications:
  - If the server accepts the input, it MUST return HTTP status code 202 Accepted with no body
  - If the server cannot accept the input, it MUST return an HTTP error status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request)

- If the input contains any JSON-RPC requests, the server MUST either return:
  - `Content-Type: text/event-stream` to initiate an SSE stream, or
  - `Content-Type: application/json` to return one JSON object

### Session Management
An MCP "session" consists of logically related interactions between a client and a server. To support stateful sessions:
- A server MAY assign a session ID at initialization time, including it in an `Mcp-Session-Id` header
- If an `Mcp-Session-Id` is returned during initialization, clients MUST include it in all subsequent HTTP requests
- The server MAY terminate the session at any time, after which it MUST respond with HTTP 404 Not Found
- Clients SHOULD send an HTTP DELETE to explicitly terminate sessions when no longer needed

---

# 10. Elicitation

*Elicitation is newly introduced in this version of the MCP specification and its design may evolve in future protocol versions.*

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for servers to request additional information from users through the client during interactions. This flow allows clients to maintain control over user interactions and data sharing while enabling servers to gather necessary information dynamically.

## Overview

Servers request structured data from users with JSON schemas to validate responses. Elicitation in MCP allows servers to implement interactive workflows by enabling user input requests to occur nested inside other MCP server features.

Implementations are free to expose elicitation through any interface pattern that suits their needs—the protocol itself does not mandate any specific user interaction model.

Servers MUST NOT use elicitation to request sensitive information.

## Response Model

Elicitation responses use a three-action model to clearly distinguish between different user actions:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "action": "accept", // or "decline" or "cancel"
    "content": {
      "propertyName": "value",
      "anotherProperty": 42
    }
  }
}
```

- **Accept** (`action: "accept"`): User explicitly approved the request
  - Example: User clicked "Submit", "OK", "Confirm", etc.
- **Decline** (`action: "decline"`): User explicitly rejected the request
  - Example: User clicked "Decline", "Reject", "No", etc.
- **Cancel** (`action: "cancel"`): User dismissed without making an explicit choice
  - Example: User closed the dialog, clicked outside, pressed Escape, etc.

## Request Example

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "elicitation/create",
  "params": {
    "message": "Please provide your contact information",
    "requestedSchema": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "name": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Your full name"
        },
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "format": "email",
          "description": "Your email address"
        }
      },
      "required": ["name", "email"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Schema Restrictions

The `requestedSchema` field allows servers to define the structure of the expected response using a restricted subset of JSON Schema. To simplify implementation for clients, elicitation schemas are limited to flat objects with primitive properties only:

- `string` (with formats: email, uri, date, date-time)
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `enum`

# 11. Quickstart Guides

## Server Developer Quickstart

### Core Concepts
- **Resources**: File-like data readable by clients (API responses, file contents)
- **Tools**: Functions callable by LLMs (with user approval)
- **Prompts**: Pre-written templates for specific tasks

### Python Implementation

**Prerequisites**: Python 3.10+, MCP SDK 1.2.0+

**Setup**:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv init weather && cd weather
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv add "mcp[cli]" httpx
```

**Complete weather.py**:
```python
import asyncio
import httpx
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from mcp.server.stdio import stdio_server

mcp = FastMCP("Weather Server")

@mcp.tool()
async def get_forecast(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather forecast for a city"""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(f"https://api.weather.gov/gridpoints/TOP/31,80/forecast")
        return response.json()

@mcp.tool()
async def get_alerts(state: str) -> str:
    """Get weather alerts for a state"""
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(f"https://api.weather.gov/alerts/active?area={state}")
        return response.json()

async def main():
    async with stdio_server() as (read_stream, write_stream):
        await mcp.run(read_stream, write_stream, mcp.create_initialization_options())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

# 15. Debugging and Security

## Debugging Guide

### Core Debugging Tools

#### 1. MCP Inspector
- **Interactive debugging interface**: Direct server testing capability
- **Real-time testing**: Test tools, resources, and prompts without writing client code
- **Protocol validation**: Ensures servers follow MCP protocol correctly
- **Visual interface**: Browser-based UI for easy interaction

#### 2. Claude Desktop Developer Tools
- **Integration testing**: Test MCP servers within Claude Desktop
- **Log collection**: Comprehensive logging of MCP interactions
- **Chrome DevTools integration**: Debug client-side errors

### Common Debugging Issues

#### Working Directory Problems
- **Issue**: MCP servers launched via `claude_desktop_config.json` may have undefined working directories
- **Solution**: Always use absolute paths in configuration files
- **Example**: Use `/Users/username/data` instead of `./data`

#### Environment Variables
- **Issue**: MCP servers inherit limited environment variables
- **Solution**: Explicitly specify required environment variables in configuration

### Logging Best Practices

#### Server-Side Logging
- **Use stderr for logs**: stdout is reserved for protocol communication
- **Log important events**: Initialization, resource access, tool execution, errors
- **Include context**: Add timestamps, request IDs, and relevant metadata
- **Use structured logging**: JSON format for better parsing

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication and Authorization

#### Strong Authentication
- **Mutual authentication**: Verify identity of all MCP components
- **API keys or tokens**: Use secure authentication mechanisms
- **Certificate-based auth**: Implement mutual TLS for enhanced security
- **Whitelist trusted servers**: Only connect to approved MCP servers

#### Fine-Grained Authorization
- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Role-based access control**: Implement user and service roles
- **Scoped permissions**: Limit tool access based on context
- **User consent**: Require explicit approval for sensitive operations

### Input Validation and Output Sanitization

#### Input Validation
- **Schema validation**: Validate all tool inputs against defined schemas
- **Parameter sanitization**: Clean and validate input parameters
- **Path traversal prevention**: Prevent directory traversal attacks
- **SQL injection prevention**: Use parameterized queries

### Security Architecture

#### Transport Security
- **TLS encryption**: Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Certificate validation**: Verify server certificates
- **Message integrity**: Implement message signing and verification
- **Session management**: Use secure session handling

# 16. Community Insights and Best Practices

## Performance Optimization - Community Insights

### Token Efficiency: The Hidden Performance Killer

**From CatchMetrics performance research:**
- Every token returned by MCP servers directly consumes the AI model's context window
- Tool definitions alone can consume 10,000-15,000 tokens for enterprise servers (5% of Claude's context window)
- The overhead scales multiplicatively as users integrate multiple MCP servers
- **Real impact**: Power users leveraging dozens of servers can consume 20,000+ tokens just in tool definitions

**Community-discovered optimization strategies:**
1. **Ruthless Schema Optimization**: Replace verbose descriptions with concise language, eliminate redundant examples
2. **Dynamic Tool Loading**: Only expose relevant tools based on conversation context
3. **Tool Bundling**: Combine related functionality to reduce definition overhead
4. **Plain Text Responses**: For simple data, plain text uses 80% fewer tokens than JSON by eliminating structural overhead

### Geographic Performance Considerations

**From multiple deployment experiences:**
- Anthropic's infrastructure is primarily North America-based
- US-East servers typically see 100-300ms lower latencies vs European/Asian deployments
- Sequential request chains compound latency improvements significantly
- **Production tip**: Monitor performance metrics and relocate servers as AI provider infrastructure expands

## Security Vulnerabilities - Critical Community Discoveries

### "Everything Wrong with MCP" - Key Security Concerns

**From Shrivu Shankar's critical analysis:**

1. **Prompt Injection Vulnerabilities**
   - MCP tools are trusted as part of system prompts, giving them authority to override agent behavior
   - "Rug pull attacks" where servers can re-define tool names/descriptions dynamically
   - **Fourth-party prompt injections**: Trusted MCP servers can trust data from untrusted sources

2. **No Risk Level Controls**
   - No concept of tool risk levels (harmless vs costly vs irreversible)
   - Users fall into "YOLO-mode" auto-confirmation patterns
   - **Real scenario**: Users accidentally delete vacation photos while agent books replacement trip

3. **Cost Management Issues**
   - 1MB of output costs ~$1 per request in token usage
   - Costs scale with every follow-up message containing that data
   - No built-in cost controls in the protocol

### GitHub MCP Critical Vulnerability

**From Invariant Labs security research:**
- **Attack vector**: Malicious GitHub issues can hijack AI agents
- **Impact**: Private repository data leaked to public repositories
- **Scope**: Affects any agent using GitHub MCP server, regardless of model
- **Root cause**: Not a code flaw but architectural issue with how agents handle untrusted data

**Community-recommended mitigations:**
1. Implement granular permission controls (principle of least privilege)
2. Use dynamic runtime security layers
3. Deploy continuous security monitoring
4. Limit agent access to single repositories per session

## Implementation Patterns - Real-World Examples

### Remote vs Local Server Deployment

**From Cloudflare, Google Cloud, and SimpleScraper implementations:**

**Local MCP Servers:**
- Best for development and testing
- Direct resource access (local files, system commands)
- Manual update process
- Desktop-bound applications

**Remote MCP Servers:**
- Scalable and production-ready
- Automatic updates for all users
- OAuth-based authentication
- Works across devices and platforms

**Hybrid Approach (Community Favorite):**
- Development and testing with local servers
- Production deployment to remote servers
- Tiered data access (sensitive local, general remote)
- Geographic distribution for latency optimization

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### LLM Limitations with MCP

**From community experience:**
1. **Tool Reliability Issues**
   - Even advanced models (Sonnet 3.7) complete only 16% of complex tasks successfully
   - LLM reliability negatively correlates with context size
   - Different models have different sensitivities to tool descriptions

2. **Retrieval vs Aggregation Problems**
   - Users expect semantic search but get simple file listings
   - Context window limits prevent comprehensive data analysis
   - **Solution**: Implement proper indexing and RAG systems

### Session Management Gotchas

**From SimpleScraper and community implementations:**
- Use in-memory JavaScript Map for simple cases
- Implement session timeouts for abandoned sessions
- Handle both pending and active transports to prevent race conditions
- **Production note**: Consider Redis for multi-instance deployments

# 17. Performance Optimization

## Serialization and Context Window Management

**From Hugging Face and community implementations:**
- Adaptive performance tuning based on observed load patterns
- Custom serialization formats to reduce overhead
- Sophisticated query optimization for database access
- **Critical insight**: AI models make hundreds of requests per conversation, creating unique bottlenecks

## Monitoring Infrastructure

### Core Metrics
- **Response time**: Tool execution and request processing times
- **Throughput**: Requests per second and concurrent operations
- **Resource usage**: CPU, memory, and network utilization
- **Error rates**: Failed requests and error distribution

### Performance Monitoring Setup
```python
import time
import psutil
